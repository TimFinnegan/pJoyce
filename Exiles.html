 <p>RICHARD ROWAN, a writer.</p>

<p>BERTHA.</p>

<p>ARCHIE, their son, aged eight years.</p>

<p>ROBERT HAND, journalist.</p>

<p>BEATRICE JUSTICE, his cousin, music teacher.</p>

<p>BRIGID, an old servant of the Rowan family.</p>

<p>A FISHWOMAN.</p>

<br />

<p>At Merrion and Ranelagh, suburbs of Dublin.</p>

<p>Summer of the year 1912.</p>

<br />
<br />


<b>First Act</b>

<p class="stage"><i>(The drawingroom in Richard Rowan's house at Merrion, a suburb of Dublin. On the right, forward, a fireplace, before which stands a low screen. Over the mantelpiece a giltframed glass. Further back in the right wall, folding doors leading to the parlour and kitchen. In the wall at the back to the right a small door leading to a study. Left of this a sideboard. On the wall above the sideboard a framed crayon drawing of a young man. More to the left double doors with glass panels leading out to the garden. In the wall at the left a window looking out on the road. Forward in the same wall a door leading to the hall and the upper part of the house. Between the window and door a lady's davenport stands against the wall. Near it a wicker chair. In the centre of the room a round table. Chairs, upholstered in faded green plush, stand round the table. To the right, forward, a smaller table with a smoking service on it. Near it an easychair and a lounge. Cocoanut mats lie before the fireplace, beside the lounge and before the doors. The floor is of stained planking. The double doors at the back and the folding doors at the right have lace curtains, which are drawn halfway. The lower sash of the window is lifted and the window is hung with heavy green plush curtains. The blind is pulled down to the edge of the lifted lower sash. It is a warm afternoon in June and the room is filled with soft sunlight which is waning.)</i></p>

<p class="stage"><i>(Brigid and Beatrice Justice come in by the door on the left. Brigid is an elderly woman, lowsized, with irongrey hair. Beatrice Justice is a slender dark young woman of 27 years. She wears a wellmade navyblue costume and an elegant simply trimmed black straw hat, and carries a small portfolioshaped handbag.)</i></p>

<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p>The mistress and Master Archie is at the bath. They never expected you. Did you send word you were back, Miss Justice?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>No. I arrived just now.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p><i>(Points to the easychair.)</i> Sit down and I'll tell the master you are here. Were you long in the train?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Sitting down.)</i> Since morning.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p>Master Archie got your postcard with the views of Youghal. You're tired out, I'm sure.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

 <p>O, no. <i>(She coughs rather nervously.)</i> Did he practise the piano while I was away?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p><i>(Laughs heartily.)</i> Practice, how are you! Is it Master Archie? He is mad after the milkman's horse now. Had you nice weather down there, Miss Justice?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Rather wet, I think.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p><i>(Sympathetically.)</i> Look at that now. And there is rain overhead too. <i>(Moving towards the study.)</i> I'll tell him you are here.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Is Mr Rowan in?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p><i>(Points.)</i> He is in his study. He is wearing himself out about something he is writing. Up half the night he does be. <i>(Going.)</i> I'll call him.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Don't disturb him, Brigid. I can wait here till they come back if they are not long.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p>And I saw something in the letterbox when I was letting you in. <i>(She crosses to the study door, opens it slightly and calls.)</i> Master Richard, Miss Justice is here for Master Archie's lesson.</p>

<p class="stage"><i>(Richard Rowan comes in from the study and advances towards Beatrice, holding out his hand. He is a tall athletic young man of a rather lazy carriage. He has light brown hair and a moustache and wears glasses. He is dressed in loose lightgrey tweed.)</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Welcome.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Rises and shakes hands, blushing slightly.)</i>
Good afternoon, Mr Rowan. I did not want Brigid to disturb you.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Disturb me?
My goodness!</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p>There is something in the letterbox, sir.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Takes a small bunch of keys from his pocket and hands them to her.)</i> Here.</p>

<p class="stage"><i>(Brigid goes out by the door at the left and is heard opening and closing the box. A short pause. She enters with two newspapers in her hands.)</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Letters?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BRIGID</p>

<p>No, sir. Only them Italian newspapers.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Leave them on my desk, will you?</p>

<p class="stage"><i>(Brigid hands him back the keys, leaves the newspapers in the study, comes out again and goes out by the folding doors on the right.)</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Please, sit down. Bertha will be back in a moment.</p>

<p class="stage"><i>(Beatrice sits down again in the easychair. Richard sits beside the table.)</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>I had begun to think you would never come back. It is twelve days since you were here.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>I thought of that too. But I have come.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Have you thought over what I told you when you were here last?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Very much.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>You must have known it before. Did you? <i>(She does not answer.)</i> Do you blame me?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>No.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Do you think I have acted towards you&mdash; badly? No? Or towards anyone?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Looks at him with a sad puzzled expression.)</i>
I have asked myself that question.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>And the answer?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>I could not answer it.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>If I were a painter and told you I had a book of sketches of you you would not think it so strange, would you?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>It is not quite the same case, is it?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Smiles slightly.)</i> Not quite. I told you also that I would not show you what I had written unless you asked to see it. Well?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>I will not ask you.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Leans forward, resting his elbows on his knees, his hands joined.)</i> Would you like to see it?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Very much.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Because it is about yourself?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Yes. But not only that.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Because it is written by me? Yes? Even if what you would find there is sometimes cruel?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Shyly.)</i> That is part of your mind, too.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Then it is my mind that attracts you? Is that it?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Hesitating, glances at him for an instant.)</i>
Why do you think I come here?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Why? Many reasons. To give Archie lessons. We have known one another so many years, from childhood, Robert, you and I&mdash; haven't we? You have always been interested in me, before I went away and while I was away. Then our letters to each other about my book. Now it is published. I am here again. Perhaps you feel that some new thing is gathering in my brain; perhaps you feel that you should know it. Is that the reason?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>No.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Why, then?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Otherwise I could not see you.</p>

<p class="stage"><i>(She looks at him for a moment and then turns aside quickly.)</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(After a pause repeats uncertainly.)</i>
Otherwise you could not see me?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Suddenly confused.)</i> I had better go. They are not coming back. <i>(Rising.)</i> Mr Rowan, I must go.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Extending his arms.)</i> But you are running away. Remain. Tell me what your words mean. Are you afraid of me?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Sinks back again.)</i> Afraid? No.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Have you confidence in me? Do you feel that you know me?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Again shyly.)</i> It is hard to know anyone but oneself.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Hard to know me? I sent you from Rome the chapters of my book as I wrote them; and letters for nine long years. Well, eight years.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Yes, it was nearly a year before your first letter came.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>It was answered at once by you. And from that on you have watched me in my struggle. <i>(Joins his hands earnestly.)</i> Tell me, Miss Justice, did you feel that what you read was written for your eyes? Or that you inspired me?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Shakes her head.)</i> I need not answer that question.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>What then?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Is silent for a moment.)</i> I cannot say it. You yourself must ask me, Mr Rowan.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(With some vehemence.)</i> Then that I expressed in those chapters and letters, and in my character and life as well, something in your soul which you could not&mdash; pride or scorn?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Could not?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Leans towards her.)</i> Could not because you dared not. Is that why?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Bends her head.)</i> Yes.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>On account of others or for want of courage&mdash; which?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Softly.)</i> Courage.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Slowly.)</i> And so you have followed me with pride and scorn also in your heart?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>And loneliness.</p>

<p class="stage"><i>(She leans her head on her hand, averting her face. Richard rises and walks slowly to the window on the left. He looks out for some moments and then returns towards her, crosses to the lounge and sits down near her.)</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Do you love him still?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>I do not even know.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>It was that that made me so reserved with you&mdash; then&mdash; even though I felt your interest in me, even though I felt that I too was something in your life.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>You were.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Yet that separated me from you. I was a third person I felt. Your names were always spoken together, Robert and Beatrice, as long as I can remember. It seemed to me, to everyone...</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>We are first cousins. It is not strange that we were often together.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>He told me of your secret engagement with him. He had no secrets from me; I suppose you know that.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(Uneasily.)</i> What happened&mdash; between us&mdash; is so long ago. I was a child.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Smiles maliciously.)</i> A child? Are you sure? It was in the garden of his mother's house. No? <i>(He points towards the garden.)</i> Over there. You plighted your troth, as they say, with a kiss. And you gave him your garter. Is it allowed to mention that?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p><i>(With some reserve.)</i> If you think it worthy of mention.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>I think you have not forgotten it. <i>(Clasping his hands quietly.)</i> I do not understand it. I thought, too, that after I had gone... Did my going make you suffer?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>I always knew you would go some day. I did not suffer; only I was changed.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Towards him?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>Everything was changed. His life, his mind, even, seemed to change after that.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Musing.)</i> Yes. I saw that you had changed when I received your first letter after a year; after your illness, too. You even said so in your letter.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">BEATRICE</p>

<p>It brought me near to death. It made me see things differently.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>

<p><i>(Toying with the lounge cushion.)</i> Do you kiss everything that is beautiful for you?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Everything&mdash;
if it can be kissed. <i>(He takes up a flat stone which lies on the table.)</i> This stone, for instance. It is so cool, so polished, so delicate, like a woman's temple. It is silent, it suffers our passion; and it is beautiful. <i>(He places it against his lips.)</i>
And so I kiss it because it is beautiful. And what is a woman? A work of nature, too, like a stone or a flower or a bird. A kiss is an act of homage.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>It is an act of union between man and woman. Even if we are often led to desire through the sense of beauty can you say that the beautiful is what we desire?</p>

<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Pressing the stone to his forehead.)</i> You will give me a headache if you make me think today. I cannot think today. I feel too natural, too common. After all, what is most attractive in even the most beautiful woman?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>What?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Not those qualities which she has and other women have not but the qualities which she has in common with them. I mean... the commonest. <i>(Turning over the stone, he presses the other side to his forehead.)</i>
I mean how her body develops heat when it is pressed, the movement of her blood, how quickly she changes by digestion what she eats into&mdash; what shall be nameless. <i>(Laughing.)</i> I am very common today. Perhaps that idea never struck you?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Drily.)</i> Many ideas strike a man who has lived nine years with a woman.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Yes. I suppose they do.... This beautiful cool stone does me good. Is it a paperweight or a cure for headache?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Bertha brought it home one day from the strand. She, too, says that it is beautiful.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Lays down the stone quietly.)</i> She is right.</p>

<p><i>(He raises his glass, and drinks. A pause.)</i></p>

<p>Is that all you wanted to say to me?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Quickly.)</i> There is something else. The vicechancellor sends you, through me, an invitation for tonight&mdash; to dinner at his house. You know where he lives? <i>(Richard nods.)</i> I thought you might have forgotten. Strictly private, of course. He wants to meet you again and sends you a very warm invitation.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>For what hour?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Eight. But, like yourself, he is free and easy about time. Now, Richard, you must go there. That is all. I feel tonight will be the turningpoint in your life. You will live here and work here and think here and be honoured here&mdash; among our people.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Smiling.)</i> I can almost see two envoys starting for the United States to collect funds for my statue a hundred years hence.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Agreeably.)</i> Once I made a little epigram about statues. All statues are of two kinds. <i>(He folds his arms across his chest.)</i>
The statue which says: <i>How shall I get down?</i> and the other kind <i>(he unfolds his arms and extends his right arm, averting his head)</i> the statue which says: <i>In my time the dunghill was so high.</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>The second one for me, please.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Lazily.)</i> Will you give me one of those long cigars of yours?</p>

<p><i>(Richard selects a Virginia cigar from the box on the table and hands it to him with the straw drawn out.)</i></p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Lighting it.)</i> These cigars Europeanize me. If Ireland is to become a new Ireland she must first become European. And that is what you are here for, Richard. Some day we shall have to choose between England and Europe. I am a descendant of the dark foreigners: that is why I like to be here. I may be childish. But where else in Dublin can I get a bandit cigar like this or a cup of black coffee? The man who drinks black coffee is going to conquer Ireland. And now I will take just a half measure of that whisky, Richard, to show you there is no ill feeling.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>

<p><i>(Points.)</i> Help yourself.</p>

<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Does so.)</i> Thanks. <i>(He drinks and goes on as before.)</i> Then you yourself, the way you loll on that lounge: then your boy's voice and also&mdash; Bertha herself. Do you allow me to call her that, Richard? I mean as an old friend of both of you.</p>

<p><i>(With animation.)</i> You have that fierce indignation which lacerated the heart of Swift. You have fallen from a higher world, Richard, and you are filled with fierce indignation, when you find that life is cowardly and ignoble. While I... shall I tell you?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>

<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Gravely.)</i> I fought for you all the time you were away. I fought to bring you back. I fought to keep your place for you here. I will fight for you still because I have faith in you, the faith of a disciple in his master. I cannot say more than that. It may seem strange to you... Give me a match.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/04/p1.html" name="1">[1]</a>

<h1 id="calibre_link-6" class="calibre1">Second Act</h1>

<p><i>(A room in Robert Hand's cottage at Ranelagh. On the right, forward, a small black piano, on the rest of which is an open piece of music. Farther back a door leading to the street door. In the wall, at the back, folding doors, draped with dark curtains, leading to a bedroom. Near the piano a large table, on which is a tall oil lamp with a wide yellow shade. Chairs, upholstered, near this table. A small cardtable more forward. Against the back wall a bookcase. In the left wall, back, a window looking out into the garden, and, forward, a door and porch, also leading to the garden. Easychairs here and there. Plants in the porch and near the draped folding doors. On the walls are many framed black and white designs. In the right corner, back, a sideboard; and in the centre of the room, left of the table, a group consisting of a standing Turkish pipe, a low oil stove, which is not lit, and a rocking chair. It is the evening of the same day.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Robert Hand, in evening dress, is seated at the piano. The candles are not lit but the lamp on the table is lit. He plays softly in the bass the first bars of Wolfram's song in the last act of</i>
Tannhäuser. <i>Then he breaks off and, resting an elbow on the ledge of the keyboard, meditates. Then he rises and, pulling out a pump from behind the piano, walks here and there in the room ejecting from it into the air sprays of perfume. He inhales the air slowly and then puts the pump buck behind the piano. He sits down on a chair near the table and, smoothing his hair carefully, sighs once or twice. Then, thrusting his hands into his trousers pockets, he leans back, stretches out his legs, and waits. A knock is heard at the street door. He rises quickly.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Slowly.)</i> Well, you spoke at last. You chose the right moment.</p>

<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Leans forward.)</i> Robert, not like this. For us two, no. Years, a whole life, of friendship. Think a moment. Since childhood, boyhood... No, no. Not in such a way&mdash; like thieves&mdash; at night. <i>(Glancing about him.)</i> And in such a place. No, Robert, that is not for people like us.</p>

<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>What a lesson! Richard, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to me that you have spoken&mdash; that the danger is passed. Yes, yes. <i>(Somewhat diffidently.)</i>
Because... there was some danger for you, too, if you think. Was there not?</p>

<p>What danger?</p>

<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(In the same tone.)</i> I don't know. I mean if you had not spoken. If you had watched and waited on until...</p>

<p>Until?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Bravely.)</i> Until I had come to like her more and more
(because I can assure you it is only a lightheaded idea of mine), to like her deeply, to love her. Would you have spoken to me then as you have just now? <i>(Richard is silent. Robert goes on more boldly.)</i> It would have been different, would it not? For then it might have been too late while it is not too late now. What could I have said then? I could have said only: You are my friend, my dear good friend. I am very sorry but I love her. <i>(With a sudden fervent gesture.)</i> I love her and I will take her from you, however I can, because I love her.</p>

<p><i>(They look at each other for some moments in silence.)</i></p>

<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p><i>(Calmly.)</i> That is the language I have heard often and never believed in. Do you mean by stealth or by violence? Steal you could not in my house because the doors were open: nor take by violence if there were no resistance.</p>

What am I saying? Or what am I thinking? I wish you would upbraid me, curse me, hate me as I deserve. You love this woman. I remember all you told me long ago. She is yours, your work. <i>(Suddenly.)</i> And that is why I, too, was drawn to her. You are so strong that you attract me even through her.</p>

<p><i>(Rapidly.)</i> Those are moments of sheer madness when we feel an intense passion for a woman. We see nothing. We think of nothing. Only to possess her. Call it brutal, bestial, what you will.</p>

<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Impatiently.)</i> No man ever yet lived on thus earth who did not long to possess&mdash; I mean to possess in the flesh&mdash; the woman whom he loves. It is nature's law.</p>

<p>Nothing else?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Nothing else. Unless I thought of two things at the same time. I am like that. If my best friend lay in his coffin and his face had a comic expression I should smile. <i>(With a little gesture of despair.)</i> I am like that. But I should suffer too, deeply.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p><i>(Shakes his head.)</i> No. Neither an angel nor an Anglo-Saxon. Two things, by the way, for which I have very little sympathy.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>

<p>Never then? Never even... with her? Tell me. I wish to know.</p>

<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>I feel in my heart something different. I believe that on the last day (if it ever comes), when we are all assembled together, that the Almighty will speak to us like this. We will say that we lived chastely with one other creature...</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Or that we tried to. And He will say to us: Fools! Who told you that you were to give yourselves to one being only? You were made to give yourselves to many freely. I wrote that law with My finger on your hearts.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Yes. Can we close our heart against an affection which we feel deeply? Should we close it? Should she?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>

<p>We are speaking of bodily union.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Affection between man and woman must come to that. We think too much of it because our minds are warped. For us today it is of no more consequence than any other form of contact&mdash; than a kiss.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>If it is of no consequence why are you dissatisfied till you reach that end? Why were you waiting here tonight?</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">ROBERT</p>

<p>Passion tends to go as far as it can; but, you may believe me or not, I had not that in my mind&mdash; to reach that end.</p>

 <a href="http://exilespages.blogspot.com/2016/03/p69.html" name="69">[69]</a>
<p class="spk">RICHARD</p>

<p>Reach it if you can. I will use no arm against you that the world puts in my hand. If the law which God's finger has written on our hearts is the law you say I too am God's creature.</p>

<p><i>(He rises and paces to and fro some moments in silence. Then he goes towards the porch and leans against the jamb. Robert watches him.)</i></p>

<p><i>(Lays his hand on his arm.)</i> Listen. She is dead. She lies on my bed. I look at her body which I betrayed&mdash; grossly and many times. And loved, too, and wept over.

<p><i>(Turns towards him, almost fiercely.)</i>
Not that fear. But that I will reproach myself then for having taken all for myself because I would not suffer her to give to another what was hers and not mine to give, because I accepted from her her loyalty and made her life poorer in love. That is my fear. That I stand between her and any moments of life that should be hers, between her and you, between her and anyone, between her and anything. I will not do it. I cannot and I will not. I dare not.</p>

<p><i>(With growing excitement.)</i> A battle of both our souls, different as they are, against all that is false in them and in the world. A battle of your soul against the spectre of fidelity, of mine against the spectre of friendship. All life is a conquest, the victory of human passion over the commandments of cowardice. Will you, Richard? Have you the courage? Even if it shatters to atoms the friendship between us, even if it breaks up for ever the last illusion in your own life? There was an eternity before we were born: another will come after we are dead. The blinding instant of passion alone&mdash; passion, free, unashamed, irresistible&mdash; that is the only gate by which we can escape from the misery of what slaves call life. Is not this the language of your own youth that I heard so often from you in this very place where we are sitting now? Have you changed?</p>

<p><i>(With increasing excitement.)</i> Bertha, I accept what is to be. I have trusted you. I will trust you still.</p>

<p>To have that against me. To leave me then. <i>(Almost passionately.)</i> Why do you not defend me then against him? Why do you go away from me now without a word? Dick, my God, tell me what you wish me to do?</p>

 <p>I cannot, dear. <i>(Struggling with himself.)</i> Your own heart will tell you. <i>(He seizes both her hands.)</i> I have a wild delight in my soul, Bertha, as I look at you.

<p>And I do too. You may be his and mine. I will trust you, Bertha, and him too. I must. I cannot hate him since his arms have been around you. You have drawn us near together. There is something wiser than wisdom in your heart. Who am I that I should call myself master of your heart or of any woman's? Bertha, love him, be his, give yourself to him if you desire&mdash; or if you can.</p>

<p>Well, after what took place here yesterday afternoon&mdash; I mean what Robert said, that Mr Rowan had accepted this position. It was only natural I should think...</p>

<p>Only the noise of his valise being pulled along the floor. Then I heard him walking about his room, whistling softly. And then locking it and strapping it.</p>

In exile, we have said, but here we must distinguish. There is an economic and there is a spiritual exile.

<p>Then I went to a certain nightclub. There were men there&mdash; and also women. At least, they looked like women. I danced with one of them. She asked me to see her home. Shall I go on?</p>

<p>I saw her home in a cab. She lives near Donnybrook. In the cab took place what the subtle Duns Scotus calls a death of the spirit. Shall I go on?</p>

<p>She wept. She told me she was the divorced wife of a barrister. I offered her a sovereign as she told me she was short of money. She would not take it and wept very much. Then she drank some melissa water from a little bottle which she had in her satchel. I saw her enter her house. Then I walked home. In my room I found that my coat was all stained with the melissa water. I had no luck even with my coats yesterday: that was the second one. The idea came to me then to change my suit and go away by the morning boat. I packed my valise and went to bed. I am going away by the next train to my cousin, Jack Justice, in Surrey. Perhaps for a fortnight. Perhaps longer. Are you disgusted?</p>
