These files have several subtle innovations:

- one-page html allows concordance-style search

- hidden table-of-contents appears in blue when you hover below the title

- below-left of each paragraph is a hidden pagenumber and link to an annotations page (the Ulysses annotation pages include Frank Delaney's podcasts)

- hovering over these Finnegans Wake pagenumbers gives a popup synopsis of the paragraph

- pagenumbers work as named anchors (eg #3)

- the Ulysses has limited experimental popup notes

- the Ulysses text is based on the 1922 first edition with Gaskell & Hart's corrections

- the Finnegans Wake is based on TrentU's html with Fweet.org's corrections

- hovering over the FW text highlights and pops-up suggested changes from the "Restored" FW

- FW II.2 introduces a new simplified pagelayout that treats the lefthand marginalia as a second style of footnote
