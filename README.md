# The pJoyce collection

### Commodious new web-savvy editions of Ulysses, Finnegans Wake, Portrait of the Artist, Dubliners, Exiles, and the poems of James Joyce

The intended use is that you click the "Download ZIP" button at the top right of https://github.com/TimFinnegan/pJoyce to download the 2Mb zipped "master-pJoyce" folder, unzip it, and bookmark at least one of the html files (the others are all conveniently linked at the top and bottom of each page so they don't have to be bookmarked separately).

Since they're hosted on your local drive, they take only a few seconds to load, and can be easily searched using your browser's 'Find' command. For additional background on any passage (including images and maps) after every paragraph, at the far left of the blank line, is a hidden blue link that appears if you hover, and links to an annotations-page specific to that paragraph-above, which page in turn attempts to link every Web resource relevant to that paragraph... and even includes a comments-form for suggestions.

(Some paragraph-specific annotations-pages are still to be created, but their links should at least go to placeholders with general resources for the whole chapter.)

Other features:

- one-page html allows concordance-style search

- hidden table-of-contents appears in blue when you hover below the title

- below-left of each paragraph is a hidden pagenumber and link to an annotations page (the Ulysses annotation pages include Frank Delaney's podcasts)

- hovering over these Finnegans Wake pagenumbers gives a popup synopsis of the paragraph

- pagenumbers work as named anchors (eg #3)

- the Ulysses has limited experimental popup notes

- the Ulysses text is based on the 1922 first edition with Gaskell & Hart's corrections

- the Finnegans Wake is based on TrentU's html with Fweet.org's corrections

- hovering over the FW text highlights and pops-up suggested changes from the "Restored" FW

- FW II.2 introduces a new simplified pagelayout that treats the lefthand marginalia as a second style of footnote
