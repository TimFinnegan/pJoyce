<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Strings in the earth and air<br />
Make music sweet;<br />
Strings by the river where<br />
The willows meet.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
There's music along the river<br />
For Love wanders there,<br />
Pale flowers on his mantle,<br />
Dark leaves on his hair.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
All softly playing.<br />
With head to the music bent,<br />
And fingers straying<br />
Upon an instrument.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>II</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
The twilight turns from amethyst<br />
To deep and deeper blue,<br />
The lamp fills with a pale green glow<br />
The trees of the avenue.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
The old piano plays an air.<br />
Sedate and slow and gay;<br />
She bends upon the yellow keys,<br />
Her head inclines this way.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Shy thoughts and grave wide eyes and hands<br />
That wander as they list &mdash;<br />
The twilight turns to darker blue<br />
With lights of amethyst.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>III</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
At that hour when all things have repose,<br />
O lonely watcher of the skies,<br />
Do you hear the night wind and the sighs<br />
Of harps playing unto Love to unclose<br />
The pale gates of sunrise?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
When all things repose do you alone<br />
Awake to hear the sweet harps play<br />
To Love before him on his way,<br />
And the night wind answering in antiphon<br />
Till night is overgone?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Play on, invisible harps, unto Love<br />
Whose way in heaven is aglow<br />
At that hour when soft lights come and go,<br />
Soft sweet music in the air above<br />
And in the earth below.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>IV</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
When the shy star goes forth in heaven<br />
All maidenly, disconsolate,<br />
Hear you amid the drowsy even<br />
One who is singing by your gate.<br />
His song is softer than the dew<br />
And he is come to visit you.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
O bend no more in revery<br />
When he at eventide is calling.<br />
Nor muse: Who may this singer be<br />
Whose song about my heart is falling?<br />
Know you by this, the lover^s chant,<br />
'Tis I that am your visitant.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>V</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Lean out of the window,<br />
Goldenhair,<br />
I heard you singing<br />
A merry air.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
My book was closed;<br />
I read no more,<br />
Watching the fire dance<br />
On the floor.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
I have left my book:<br />
I have left my room:<br />
For I heard you singing<br />
Through the gloom,<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Singing and singing<br />
A merry air.<br />
Lean out of the window,<br />
Goldenhair.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>VI</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
I would in that sweet bosom be<br />
(O sweet it is and fair it is!)<br />
Where no rude wind might visit me.<br />
Because of sad austerities<br />
I would in that sweet bosom be.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
I would be ever in that heart<br />
(O soft I knock and soft entreat her!)<br />
Where only peace might be my part.<br />
Austerities were all the sweeter<br />
So I were ever in that heart.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>VII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
My love is in a light attire<br />
Among the apple-trees<br />
Where the gay winds do most desire<br />
To run in companies.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
There, where the gay winds stay to woo<br />
The young leaves as they pass,<br />
My love goes slowly, bending to<br />
Her shadow on the grass;<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
And where the sky's a pale blue cup<br />
Over the laughing land,<br />
My love goes lightly, holding up<br />
Her dress with dainty hand.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>VIII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Who goes amid the green wood<br />
With springtide all adorning her?<br />
Who goes amid the merry green wood<br />
To make it merrier?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Who passes in the sunlight<br />
By ways that know the light footfall?<br />
Who passes in the sweet sunlight<br />
With mien so virginal?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
The ways of all the woodland<br />
Gleam with a soft and golden fire &mdash;<br />
For whom does all the sunny woodland<br />
Carry so brave attire?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
O, it is for my true love<br />
The woods their rich apparel wear &mdash;<br />
O, it is for my own true love,<br />
That is so young and fair.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>IX</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Winds of May, that dance on the sea,<br />
Dancing a ringaround in glee<br />
From furrow to furrow, while overhead<br />
The foam flies up to be garlanded,<br />
In silvery arches spanning the air,<br />
Saw you my true love anywhere?<br />
Welladay! Welladay!<br />
For the winds of May!<br />
Love is unhappy when love is away!<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>X</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Bright cap and streamers,<br />
He sings in the hollow:<br />
Come follow, come follow.<br />
All you that love.<br />
Leave dreams to the dreamers<br />
That will not after,<br />
That song and laughter<br />
Do nothing move.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
With ribbons streaming<br />
He sings the bolder;<br />
In troop at his shoulder<br />
The wild bees hum.<br />
And the time of dreaming<br />
Dreams is over &mdash;<br />
As lover to lover.<br />
Sweetheart, I come.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XI</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Bid adieu, adieu, adieu,<br />
Bid adieu to girlish days.<br />
Happy Love is come to woo<br />
Thee and woo thy girlish ways &mdash;<br />
The zone that doth become thee fair,<br />
The snood upon thy yellow hair.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
When thou hast heard his name upon<br />
The bugles of the cherubim<br />
Begin thou softly to unzone<br />
Thy girlish bosom unto him<br />
And softly to undoi the snood<br />
That is the sign of maidenhood.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
What counsel has the hooded moon<br />
Put in thy heart, my shyly sweet,<br />
Of Love in ancient plenilune,<br />
Glory and stars beneath his feet &mdash;<br />
A sage that is but kith and kin<br />
With the comedian capuchin?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Believe me rather that am wise<br />
In disregard of the divine.<br />
A glory kindles in those eyes,<br />
Trembles to starlight. Mine, O Mine!<br />
No more be tears in moon or mist<br />
For thee, sweet sentimentalist.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XIII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Go seek her out all courteously<br />
And say I come,<br />
Wind of spices whose song is ever<br />
Epithalamium.<br />
O, hurry over the dark lands<br />
And run upon the sea<br />
For seas and land shall not divide us,<br />
My love and me.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Now, wind, of your good courtesy<br />
I pray you go<br />
And come into her little garden<br />
And sing at her window;<br />
Singing: The bridal wind is blowing<br />
For Love is at his noon;<br />
And soon will your true love be with you,<br />
Soon, O soon.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XIV</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
My dove, my beautiful one,<br />
Arise, arise!<br />
The nightdew lies<br />
Upon my lips and eyes.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
The odorous winds are weaving<br />
A music of sighs:<br />
Arise, arise,<br />
My dove, my beautiful one!<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
I wait by the cedar tree.<br />
My sister, my love.<br />
White breast of the dove,<br />
My breast shall be your bed.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
The pale dew lies<br />
Like a veil on my head.<br />
My fair one, my fair dove.<br />
Arise, arise!<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XV</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
From dewy dreams, my soul, arise,<br />
From love's deep slumber and from death,<br />
For lo! the trees are full of sighs<br />
Whose leaves the morn admonisheth.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Eastward the gradual dawn prevails<br />
Where softly burning fires appear,<br />
Making to tremble all those veils<br />
Of grey and golden gossamer.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
While sweetly, gently, secretly.<br />
The flowery bells of morn are stirred<br />
And the wise choirs of faery<br />
Begin (innumerous!) to be heard.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XVI</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
O cool is the valley now<br />
And there, love, will we go<br />
For many a choir is singing now<br />
Where Love did sometime go.<br />
And hear you not the thrushes calling,<br />
Calling us away?<br />
O cool and pleasant is the valley<br />
And there, love, will we stay.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XVII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Because your voice was at my side<br />
I gave him pain,<br />
Because within my hand I held<br />
Your hand again.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
There is no word nor any sign<br />
Can make amend &mdash;<br />
He is a stranger to me now<br />
Who was my friend.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XVIII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
O sweetheart, hear you<br />
Your lover's tale;<br />
A man shall have sorrow<br />
When friends him fail.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
For he shall know then<br />
Friends be untrue<br />
And a little ashes<br />
Their words come to.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
But one unto him<br />
Will softly move<br />
And softly woo him<br />
In ways of love.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
His hand is under<br />
Her smooth round breast;<br />
So he who has sorrow<br />
Shall have rest.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XIX</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Be not sad because all men<br />
Prefer a lying clamour before you:<br />
Sweetheart, be at peace again &mdash;<br />
Can they dishonor you?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
They are sadder than all tears;<br />
Their lives ascend as a continual sigh.<br />
Proudly answer to their tears:<br />
As they deny, deny.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XX</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
In the dark pinewood<br />
I would we lay,<br />
In deep cool shadow<br />
At noon of day.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
How sweet to lie there,<br />
Sweet to kiss,<br />
Where the great pine forest<br />
Enaisled is!<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Thy kiss descending<br />
Sweeter were<br />
With a soft tumult<br />
Of thy hair.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
O, unto the pinewood<br />
At noon of day<br />
Come with me now,<br />
Sweet love, away.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XXI</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
He who hath glory lost nor hath<br />
Found any soul to fellow his,<br />
Among his foes in scorn and wrath<br />
Holding to ancient nobleness,<br />
That high unconsortable one &mdash;<br />
His love is his companion.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XXII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Of that so sweet imprisonment<br />
My soul, dearest, is fain &mdash;<br />
Soft arms that woo me to relent<br />
And woo me to detain.<br />
Ah, could they ever hold me there,<br />
Gladly were I a prisoner!<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Dearest, through interwoven arms<br />
By love made tremulous,<br />
That night allures me where alarms<br />
Nowise may trouble us<br />
But sleep to dreamier sleep be wed<br />
Where soul with soul lies prisoned.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XXIII</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
This heart that flutters near my heart<br />
My hope and all my riches is,<br />
Unhappy when we draw apart<br />
And happy between kiss and kiss;<br />
My hope and all my riches &mdash; yes! &mdash;<br />
And all my happiness.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
For there, as in some mossy nest<br />
The wrens will divers treasures keep,<br />
I laid those treasures I possessed<br />
Ere that mine eyes had learned to weep.<br />
Shall we not be as wise as they<br />
Though love live but a day?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XXIV</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Silently she's combing,<br />
Combing her long hair,<br />
Silently and graciously,<br />
With many a pretty air.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
The sun is in the willow leaves<br />
And on the dappled grass,<br />
And still she's combing her long hair<br />
Before the lookingglass.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
I pray you, cease to comb out,<br />
Comb out your long hair,<br />
For I have heard of witchery<br />
Under a pretty air.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
That imakes as one thing to the lover<br />
Staying and going hence,<br />
All fair, with many a pretty air<br />
And many a negligence.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XXV</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Lightly come or lightly go<br />
Though thy heart presage thee woe,<br />
Vales and many a wasted sun,<br />
Oread let thy laughter run<br />
Till the irreverent mountain air<br />
Ripple all thy flying hair.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Lightly, lightly &mdash; ever so:<br />
Clouds that wrap the vales below<br />
At the hour of evenstar<br />
Lowliest attendants are;<br />
Love and laughter songconfessed<br />
When the heart is heaviest.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
<br />
<b>XXVI</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
Thou leanest to the shell of night,<br />
Dear lady, a divining ear.<br />
In that soft choiring of delight<br />
What sound hath made thy heart to fear?<br />
Seemed it of rivers rushing forth<br />
From the grey deserts of the north?<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/04/chamber-music.html">[]</a><br />
That mood of thine, O timorous,<br />
Is his, if thou but scan it well,<br />
Who a mad tale bequeaths to us<br />
At ghosting hour conjurable &mdash;<br />

His high Castilian courtesy &#8211;<br />
Or him who loves his Master dear &#8211;<br />
Or him who drinks his pint in fear &#8211;<br />
Or him who once when snug abed<br />
Saw Jesus Christ without his head<br />
And tried so hard to win for us<br />
The long-lost works of Aeschylus.<br />
But all these men of whom I speak<br />
Make me the sewer of their clique.<br />
That they may dream their dreamy dreams<br />
I carry off their filthy streams<br />
For I can do those things for them<br />
Through which I lost my diadem,<br />
Those things for which Grandmother Church<br />
Left me severely in the lurch.<br />
Thus I relieve their timid arses,<br />
Perform my office of Katharsis.<br />
My scarlet leaves them white as wool:<br />
Through me they purge a bellyful.<br />
To sister mummers one and all<br />
I act as vicar-general<br />
And for each maiden, shy and nervous,<br />
I do a similar kind of service.<br />
For I detect without surprise<br />
That shadowy beauty in her eyes,<br />
The 'dare not' of sweet maidenhood<br />
That answers my corruptive 'would',<br />
Whenever publicly we meet<br />
She never seems to think of it;<br />
At night when close in bed she lies<br />
And feels my hand between her thighs<br />
My little love in light attire<br />
Knows the soft flame that is desire.<br />
But Mammon places under ban<br />
The uses of Leviathan<br />
And that high spirit ever wars<br />
On Mammon's countless servitors<br />
Nor can they ever be exempt<br />
From his taxation of contempt.<br />
So distantly I turn to view<br />
The shamblings of that motley crew,<br />
Those souls that hate the strength that mine has<br />
Steeled in the school of old Aquinas.<br />
Where they have crouched and crawled and prayed<br />
I stand, the self-doomed, unafraid,<br />
Unfellowed, friendless and alone,<br />
Indifferent as the herring-bone,<br />
Firm as the mountain-ridges where<br />
I flash my antlers on the air.<br />
Let them continue as is meet<br />
To adequate the balance-sheet.<br />
Though they may labour to the grave<br />
My spirit shall they never have<br />
Nor make my soul with theirs as one<br />
Till the Mahamanvantara be done:<br />
And though they spurn me from their door<br />
My soul shall spurn them evermore.<br />

<b>Gas from a Burner</b><br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
Ladies and gents, you are here assembled<br />
To hear why earth and heaven trembled<br />
Because of the black and sinister arts<br />
Of an Irish writer in foreign parts.<br />
He sent me a book ten years ago.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
I read it a hundred times or so,<br />
Backwards and forwards, down and up,<br />
Through both the ends of a telescope.<br />
I printed it all to the very last word<br />
But by the mercy of the Lord<br />
The darkness of my mind was rent<br />
And I saw the writer's foul intent.<br />
But I owe a duty to Ireland:<br />
I held her honour in my hand,<br />
This lovely land that always sent<br />
Her writers and artists to banishment<br />
And in a spirit of Irish fun<br />
Betrayed her own leaders, one by one.<br />
'Twas Irish humour, wet and dry,<br />
Flung quicklime into Parnell's eye;<br />
'Tis Irish brains that save from doom<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
The leaky barge of the Bishop of Rome<br />
For everyone knows the Pope can't belch<br />
Without the consent of Billy Walsh.<br />
O Ireland my first and only love<br />
Where Christ and Caesar are hand and glove!<br />
O lovely land where the shamrock grows!<br />
(Allow me, ladies, to blow my nose)<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
To show you for strictures I don't care a button<br />
I printed the poems of Mountainy Mutton<br />
And a play he wrote (you've read it I'm sure)<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
Where they talk of 'bastard', 'bugger' and 'whore'<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
And a play on the Word and Holy Paul<br />
And some woman's legs that I can't recall<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
Written by Moore, a genuine gent<br />
That lives on his property's ten per cent:<br />
I printed mystical books in dozens:<br />
I printed the table-book of Cousins<br />
Though (asking your pardon) as for the verse<br />
'Twould give you a heartburn on your arse:<br />
I printed folklore from North and South<br />
By Gregory of the Golden Mouth:<br />
I printed poets, sad, silly and solemn:<br />
I printed Patrick What-do-you-Colm:<br />
I printed the great John Milicent Synge<br />
Who soars above on an angel's wing<br />
In the playboy shift that he pinched as swag<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
From Maunsel's manager's travelling-bag.<br />
But I draw the line at that bloody fellow<br />
That was over here dressed in Austrian yellow,<br />
Spouting Italian by the hour<br />
To O'Leary Curtis and John Wyse Power<br />
And writing of Dublin, dirty and dear,<br />
In a manner no blackamoor printer could bear.<br />
Shite and onions! Do you think I'll print<br />
The name of the Wellington Monument,<br />
Sydney Parade and Sandymount tram,<br />
Downes's cakeshop and Williams's jam?<br />
I'm damned if I do&mdash; I'm damned to blazes!<br />
Talk about _Irish Names of Places!_<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
It's a wonder to me, upon my soul,<br />
He forgot to mention Curly's Hole.<br />
No, ladies, my press shall have no share in<br />
So gross a libel on Stepmother Erin.<br />
I pity the poor&mdash; that's why I took<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
A red-headed Scotchman to keep my book.<br />
Poor sister Scotland! Her doom is fell;<br />
She cannot find any more Stuarts to sell.<br />
My conscience is fine as Chinese silk:<br />
My heart is as soft as buttermilk.<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
Colm can tell you I made a rebate<br />
Of one hundred pounds on the estimate<br />
I gave him for his Irish Review.<br />
I love my country&mdash; by herrings I do!<br />
<a href="http://annotatedpoems.blogspot.com/2016/02/gas-from-burner.html">[]</a><br />
I wish you could see what tears I weep<br />
When I think of the emigrant train and ship.<br />
That's why I publish far and wide<br />
My quite illegible railway guide,<br />
In the porch of my printing institute<br />
The poor and deserving prostitute<br />
Plays every night at catch-as-catch-can<br />
With her tight-breeched British artilleryman<br />
And the foreigner learns the gift of the gab<br />
From the drunken draggletail Dublin drab.<br />
Who was it said: Resist not evil?<br />
I'll burn that book, so help me devil.<br />
I'll sing a psalm as I watch it burn<br />
And the ashes I'll keep in a one-handled urn.<br />
I'll penance do with farts and groans<br />
Kneeling upon my marrowbones.<br />
This very next lent I will unbare<br />
My penitent buttocks to the air<br />
And sobbing beside my printing press<br />
My awful sin I will confess.<br />
My Irish foreman from Bannockburn<br />
Shall dip his right hand in the urn<br />
And sign crisscross with reverent thumb<br />
Memento homo_ upon my bum.<br />
